## The seven puzzles

Resolve some puzzles to discover what the game really wants, then help her to fullfill her dream. Depending on the primary emotion of the game, its appearence and behaviour will change, also the goals she impose you.

The core idea for this game was inspired by the novel Los siete locos, written by Roberto Arlt.

The sound effects for the game are part of the Sonniss.com - GDC 2018 - Game Audio Bundle: http://80.lv/articles/30gb-of-high-quality-sound-effects.

The sprites for the UI (those buttons at the bottom) are part of Kenney Game Assets: http://kenney.itch.io/kenney-donation.

The names of the games are from those in the  Degenatron gaming console (from GTA San Andreas).
